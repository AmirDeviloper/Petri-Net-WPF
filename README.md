# 🔄 Petri Net Simulator (WPF + .NET Framework)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **August 2024** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This desktop application was built using **C# and WPF**, designed to simulate and visualize **Petri Net diagrams** interactively. It allows users to create places, transitions, and arcs, and observe token flow in real time — ideal for educational use in modeling concurrent and distributed systems.

The system includes:

- 🧩 **Graphical Editor** – Add and connect places, transitions, and arcs  
- 🔘 **Token Simulation** – Fire transitions and observe token movement  
- 🕹️ **Interactive UI** – Drag-and-drop elements with live updates  
- ⏱️ **Step-by-Step Execution** – Manual or timed simulation modes  
- 🎨 **WPF Canvas Rendering** – Smooth visuals with scalable layout
